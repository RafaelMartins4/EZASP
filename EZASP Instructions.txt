Instructions for future developers of EZASP:
 
 	Install antlr4 - npm install antlr4

 	Inside the generate command (package.json -> "scripts" -> "generate"), you need to change the path to the ANTLR .jar file to match your own ANTLR4 installation. 
 
 	Whenever you run the generate script (npm run generate) to create updated antlr4 files, you have to manually change some things:
 
 		Change the generated files (ASPLexer.js, ASPListener.js and ASPParser.js) extensions from .js to .mjs (note: this should be done automatically by the script but you should still check if it worked). 
		This ensures that these files use ES modules instead of CommonJS. This files are generated in the 'generated/src/parser/grammar' path.
 
 		Because of the extension change, you might have to change the import of ASPListener on the 4th line of the ASPParser file (simply change .js to .mjs)

 		Furthermore, the generation of new files might give you a false error in the parser.mjs imports. You can ignore this (or simply rewrite the imports and the error will disappear).
